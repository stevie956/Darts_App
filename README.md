Once cloned, start a terminal for both the frontend (cd frontend) and backend (cd backend) folders and run the “npm install” command in both.

Start the servers in both terminals by using the "npm start" commands. If not automatically redirected, open a browser and enter http://localhost:3000/. The backend is listening on localhost:4000

Initially I was going to build this project over 4 seperate pages. However in my search for a cool css on my login form i stumbled across framer-motion which allowed me to switch forms in one container, so once I completed the form I had the brainwave of putting the whole app in the one container on the one page! Once you click on the links you can see the drop-down box and switch to the next form and eventually the scoreboard itself. It is currently unfinished. All that is left is to render player names to the ui scoreboard which I hope to complete.
